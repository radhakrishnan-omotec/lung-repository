Implementation approach for Shivaan Darda's project

Lung Cancer prediction
Brief Implementation : EDA + Correlations between features that depend on each other (e.g. Smoking & Cancer) + Building predictive models (e.g., logistic regression etc) to predict lung cancer risk based on variables like smoking, pollution, alcohol use, and other identified factors + Determining the most influential factors contributing to lung cancer risk through feature importance analysis by analyzing the feature importance scores of the Model trained on the dataset.
